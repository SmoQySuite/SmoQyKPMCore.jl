Documentation for [SmoQyKPMCore](https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyKPMCore.jl) package.
The [SmoQyKPMCore](https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyKPMCore.jl) package implements and exports an optimized,
low-level implementation of the Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) algorithm for
approximating functions of operators with strictly real, bounded eigenvalues via a Chebyshev polynomial expansion.
